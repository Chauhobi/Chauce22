           <h3> Mystery: </h3>
           <p> Why does anything exist at all?
THERE is plenty to recommend the standard model, our best description of particles and their interactions.</p>
<p> But it has the odd awkward lapse. “It is a somewhat embarrassing fact that it fails to explain our existence,” </p>
<p>says Werner Rodejohann at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Germany.</p>

           <br>
           <p>Actually, it’s worse than that: the standard model positively insists we don’t exist. It says that in the big bang, matter and antimatter should have been created in equal measure. These two famously don’t get along, annihilating one another in a flash of light whenever they come within touching distance. They should have snuffed each other out in a hot orgy of mutual destruction during the first second of the universe’s existence, leaving a cosmos filled with nothing but light. “It would look very different, not least because planets and stars and life could not evolve in such an environment,” says Tara Shears at the University of Liverpool, UK.</p>
           <p>And yet here we are. Somehow, matter won.</p>
           <p>One possibility is that the antimatter is just hiding: some of it, somehow, escaped the death match, taking refuge in little safe spots that eventually became distant regions …</p>
